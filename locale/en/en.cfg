[mod-setting-description]
ti-starting-area-resolution=Level of detail for the starting area.
ti-starting-area-lerpsteps=Steps in the interpolation to create the shape of the starting area.
ti-starting-area-radius=Determines the rough size of the starting area.
ti-starting-area-variance=Determines the variance in the border of the starting area. A good value for this is equal to Starting area radius.
ti-starting-area-windowsize=Window size used for smoothing the variance of the borders.
ti-noise-period=Period of the noise used for random map generation.
ti-noise-octaves=Represents different "levels" of noise.
ti-noise-persistence=Shrinks the contribution for each comumulative octave.
ti-level-deepwater=The "height" at which Deepwater tiles cease to appear.
ti-level-water=The "height" at which Water tiles cease to appear.
ti-level-grass=The "height" at which Grass tiles cease to appear.
ti-level-grass-medium=The "height" at which Grass Medium tiles cease to appear.
ti-level-grass-dry=The "height" at which Grass Dry tiles cease to appear.
ti-level-sand-dark=The "height" at which Sand Dark tiles cease to appear.
ti-level-red-desert-dark=The "height" at which Red Desert Dark tiles cease to appear.
